# GoldenTrainer
A mod to help you get (eventually) all golden strawberries.


## How does it work?
When activated, it respawns you when transitioning to another screen until you complete that first screen a certain number of times in a row without dying. It has the goal to help you be more consistent with every room in a chapter, to finally get the golden strawberry.
Once you have installed the mod via the Everest/Olympus launcher, you can setup : 
- If you want the mod to be activated or not
- The required number of completions before switching to another screen.

### Todo :
- Implement Summit checkpoints, because the mod currently only works with Crystal Hearts and room transitions
